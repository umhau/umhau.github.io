Quick note, this is the favored incantation to prevent too many instances of lost connections. 

```sh
mkdir /local/mount/point
sshfs -o allow_root,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3  user@remotelocation:/path/to/folder /local/mount/point
```

The extra arguments are the real magic here.  If you notice, some of those help reestablish the connection - in practice, this means that sometimes it will come back after putting your laptop to sleep.  I tend to put specific commands for specific mounts into scripts. However, you can also just put the first part with the 'incantations' into a bash alias.

```Bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Add this to the end:
```Bash
alias shfs='sshfs -o allow_root,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 '
```

Then you can simplify mounting, and make it very similar to scp and ssh:

```Bash
mkdir /local/mount/point
shfs user@remotelocation:/path/to/folder /local/mount/point
```
