So I've recently become enamoured of FreeBSD, and it's time to see where that might lead. Currently it sounds like it's got some amazing reliability, and I really like it when a list of OS design qualities includes the phrase "good engineering". That's something that I don't think applies to much of the linux world.  (Don't get me wrong: linux is amazing, and all my stuff still runs on linux, and there's a lot to be said for the general pattern of building and development that was worked out in the open-source, linux world. But I miss no-nonsense, fad-less, _engineering_.)

I'm pretty good with a lot of the basics, but my freebsd box won't connect to the ethernet I've plugged in. And I don't know how to install Samba, which is the purpose of this particular strain of the experiment. 

Internet: just have to be patient. `ifconfig` works fine to see what's there.  

Packages:

    pkg update             # update the locally-stored list of available packages
    pkg search <string>    # search the package list (and descriptions) for the string
    pkg install <package>  # install the package you found
    pkg delete <package>   # remove the package from your system
    pkg autoremove         # remove any extra unneeded dependencies after deleting a package
    
Pretty amazingly simple.
