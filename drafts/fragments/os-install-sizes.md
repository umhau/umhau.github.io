When I'm creating new VMs, often I want a separate virtual disk just for the OS, and something else for whatever data it touches. When I'm also trying to be space-concious, that means I need to know how big the virtual disk needs to be. This is a table of how much space various installations require.

| OS                      | Size      |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| FreeBSD (minimal)       | < 2GB     |
|                         |           |
