I'm hunting for a decent, lightweight pdf reader. I tend to power through a lot of papers and other stuff where I want to read without distraction; distractions include trying to remember key combinations for basic stuff like turning the page (looking at you, Zathura).  It'd also be nice to have dual pages and minimal toolbars (but still some, because I'm not interested in learning yet another set of key combos).  

Made a list of viewers available from the Void repos. Some of these are out even before installation:

    [-] apvlv-0.2.0_1                          Vim-like PDF/DJVU/TXT viewer

I don't need any more keybindings in my life.

    [-] pdf.js-2.7.570_1                       Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer built with HTML5

Too much webtech as well. JS and HTML5 is out.

    [-] gv-3.7.4_5                             Postscript and PDF viewer

Tried it; after I got into presentation mode, there was no clear way to get out, and in trying to get out I managed to make the whole thing unresponsive.  An unresponsive pdf viewer is distracting; this option's out.

    [-] qpdfview-0.4.18_2                      Tabbed document viewer

This one has all the qt dependencies with it; however, it's super fast and the navigation (arrow key page switching, ctrl + mouse wheel zoom, click and drag around the page) is top notch, and it has dual page view. The big point against it is that it's tabbed, and any new pdf opened is (apparently) opened in the same instance of the program. I'm a heavy user of workspaces, so that's super annoying. There's not even an option to 'open files in new window'. If it had that, it'd be perfect. However - skip!

    [-] mupdf-1.18.0_3                         Lightweight PDF and XPS viewer

A command line program that opens a 'gui' viewer. There's no GUI menus, so I imagine that it's all either cli-based config, or key combos. No thanks, either way.

    [-] xreader-3.0.2_1                        Document viewer capable of displaying formats like PDF and Postscript

Tries to be too fancy and too smart. Doesn't have the click and drag scrolling, and has weird defaults, and almost no settings. Bad vibes, man. I want options!

    [-] katarakt-0.2_3                         Simple PDF viewer

Too simple. So simple it's complicated. Back to unguessable key combos and no GUI menus. 

    [-] epdfview-0.1.8_12                      Lightweight PDF viewer using Poppler and GTK+

Badly made. The only reader so far that takes noticable time to load each page as I scroll through the document. No dual page view. Click and drag actually tries to change the page when it's on discrete scroll mode.  Feels glitchy. No settings available, except to choose a web browser (??!!). 

   [-] lumina-pdf-1.6.0_1                     PDF reader and presentation utility from the Lumina Desktop

Weirdest interface yet. Can't scroll through multiple pages with the mouse wheel, only inside a single zoomed-in page. Can't zoom with the mouse wheel.  Can only change page using arrow keys or page-down keys.  No settings available.  Can click-drag around the pages though.  

    [-] fbpdf-0.0.20200616_2                   Small framebuffer PDF/DJVU viewer

Didn't even work when I tried it: nothing opened up, no view of the pdf presented itself. And it uses the command line anyway.

    [-] pdfpc-4.5.0_1                          Presenter console with multi-monitor support for PDF files

Command line, with a badly made interface (file was zoomed out and off-center). Do not recommend even for the stated use.

    [-] xournalpp-1.1.0_1                      Handwriting Notetaking software with PDF annotation support

Strangely, this might actually be the solution. The only thing it's missing is the discrete scrolling, but the configurable number of page columns (instead of mere dual pages) kinda makes up for that. Plus it's a full on note taking tool, which might come in handy.  It's a bit slower, and a little jerky, but it's forgivable for the wider range of functions available.

    [-] zathura-pdf-mupdf-0.3.7_2              PDF support for zathura (using mupdf)
    [-] zathura-pdf-poppler-0.3.0_1            PDF support for zathura (using poppler)

Just like last time I tried it - no GUI menus. I don't really want to try and memorize stuff; that just seems like wasted brain space. I've got better things to use my limited mental faculties on. 

[*] xpdf-4.03_1                            Viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files
