Zotero isn't terribly complicated, but I won't remember how I set it up unless I write it down. So here I am.

The 'fun' thing I have to deal with is my penchant for using multiple computers. It's a great system, generally; very resilient. None of them were expensive, all of them were used, and I move between them constantly. This has a few implications: 

- If something breaks, I just use a different machine.
- I'm always trying to improve the data sync methods, which means backups are constantly in use and tested. 
- There's always a spare laptop to test new stuff on.

The downside, of course, is that nothing is centralized and everything has to be synchronized.  Which includes Zotero. So here I am.

I have a massive (to me) library of pdfs, and a few videos. I want to (finally) use Zotero to organize it. Zotero needs to be synchronized between several machines. Zotero uses its own a) database and b) document filesytem. Zotero likes things done its way.  

>  If you want to use Zotero data syncing but use an external service to sync just your Zotero attachment files, you have a couple options:

> The easiest method is to use linked files, rather than stored copies of files, with only your attachment files in the externally synced folder. The ZotFile plugin can make this simple by automatically moving attachment files to a designated folder as you import them. You should also set up Zotero's Linked Attachment Base Directory feature to point to the same folder so that Zotero can find your files on each computer, even if the path to the cloud storage folder differs.

So what we do is reorganize our files - insead of research and development sorted per-project, pdfs in one folder and plans in another, we're going to create parallel filesystems: research, for all projects, in one document tree, and development in another document tree.
