## list of interesting tools I've found (updated irregularly)

- Gooey Fire: https://github.com/google/python-fire & https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey. Convert a python program to a CLI, then make the CLI into a GUI.
- Privoxy: instead of an adblocker running in the browser, run it as a separate program - potentially, in a single instance for the whole network. Can do all sorts of things beyond just adblocking. (dark reader replacement?) https://www.privoxy.org/faq/index.html . Also, easylist adblocking: https://github.com/essandess/easylist-pac-privoxy
