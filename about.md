## Welcome | About

This blog attempts to be the sort of resource I used to always look for when I was getting started with linux.  It's intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  

This is where I record how I did my projects, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  It's my own hard-to-lose research journal. 

## How to use this site

Use _explore_ to see a sorted list of all posts on the site, and access the search function.  The sidebar lists categories of posts available to browse.

## Notes

This site was transferred from [Google Blogger](https://nixingaround.blogspot.com/2017/10/final-post-here.html), so the oldest pages are html and have a slightly different style.  [See here.](/new-blog-location)  The newer ones are written in markdown and (I think) tend to look better.
