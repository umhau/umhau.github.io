## Welcome | About

This blog attempts to be the sort of resource I find most helpful: intended for people who are way out of their depth, know very little about the subject matter and will probably break things, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.

This is a record of how I did my projects, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  It's documentation; a hard-to-lose research journal. 

## How to use this site

Use _explore_ to see a sorted list of all posts on the site, and access the search function.  The sidebar lists categories of posts available to browse.

## Historical Note

This site was transferred from [Google Blogger](https://nixingaround.blogspot.com/2017/10/final-post-here.html), so the oldest pages are html and have a slightly different style.  [See here.](/new-blog-location)  The newer ones are written in markdown and (I think) tend to look better.  

## Disclaimer

I'm totally not responsible for anything.  All opinons given are irrelevant, all how-tos should be considered how-don'ts, the walkthroughs are always erroneous, and all the links are broken. 

If you do anything I describe here, your computer will spontaneously catch fire and your server will start a civil war in a second world country.  If you reference this blog anywhere your colleagues will look at you funny over their glasses; and if you cite anything I write as a source then Elon Musk himself will twit that you're a twat in a tweet.
