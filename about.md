## Welcome | About

This blog attempts to be the sort of resource I used to always hope for when I was getting started with linux.  It's intended for people who are way out of their depth, but still want to forge ahead with their cool project.  This is where I record how I did my projects, step by step, with no assumptions of prior knowledge except how to paste into a linux command line.  It's good science -- ensuring reproducible results.

Memories of complex procedures tend to be transient, so this also helps me remember.  I also find that tracking each step helps me stay focused.  So, in essence, this is a research journal.

## How to use this site

Use the _explore_ button to see a sorted list of all posts on the site and to access the search function.  Alternately, the sidebar lists the categories of posts available to browse.

## Notes

This site was transferred from [Google Blogger](https://nixingaround.blogspot.com/2017/10/final-post-here.html), so the oldest pages are html and have a slightly different style.  [See here.](/new-blog-location)  The newer ones are written in markdown and (I think) tend to look better.
